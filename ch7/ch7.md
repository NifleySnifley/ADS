# Chapter 7

- A generic implementation of a DAG can be found in [generic_graph.py](generic_graph.py)
- Did a generic word translation thing in [ffoolsage.py](ffoolsage.py)
- Implemented much more efficient Knight's Tour solver with Warnsdorff's rule and bitsets in [ktour.py](ktour.py)

## Exercises

## TODO:
- Practice doing efficient DFS with proper backtracking (shared list push/pop)
